    <h2>Four Eye 1</h2>

        Influenced by multiple unconventional genres and fusions, she represents the glue that holds the group together. 
        She provides dedication, perseverance, and has very bad vision.
    </p>

    <h2>Four Eye 2</h2>
    <p>All the way from the tropics, we have our classical counterpart, known for playing the piano without looking because she claims that 
        'I don't need my eyes to see through you'. Her piano tunes pierces your heart and makes you a better person. She has bad vision.</p>

        <p>Four Eyes Three plays guitar and brings the psychedelic journey to the Four Eyes Experience. 
        Raised under the close supervision of Jimi Hendrix, Four Eyes Three is the pizazz, the spice, and also has very bad vision.
